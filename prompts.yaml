disease: "Please review the publication for descriptions or uses of zebrafish
as models of disease. Identify any experimental data that show
mutation of genes, introduction of human genes into zebrafish, 
chemical exposure, infection, or environmental changes leading to 
disease phenotypes. The publication should use zebrafish in an active manner
that models a disease and not just mention diseases without experimental
evidence to create a zebrafish model. Again, we aren't interested if disease is
simply mentioned in the introduction or discussion, it needs to be integral in some way
to the experiments described in the paper."
