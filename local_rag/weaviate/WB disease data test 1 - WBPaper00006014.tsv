Run01	Lethality	epi-1	gene	Mutations in the epi-1 gene were isolated in a screen devised to isolate mutants defective in gonad conversion from mesenchyme to epithelium. The female somatic gonad of C. elegans is a cylindrical myoepithelium that surrounds the germ cells and sustains their maturation. Mutants were isolated at the L3 and L4 stage in which the uterine precursors failed to exclude germ cells from the center of the gonad (the uterus), spermathecae failed to form a closed lumen, or the ovarian sheath cells failed to spread over the adjacent germ cells. One of the genes identified in this screen was designated epi-1 (epithelialization).
Run02	muscular dystrophies	lam-3	gene	Mutations in the C. elegans laminin gene lam-3 result in disturbances in cell polarity, differentiation, proliferation, and migration, mirroring defects seen in muscular dystrophies in humans where laminin mutations are implicated. These findings in C. elegans demonstrate the gene's crucial role in tissue integrity and function, providing insights into the molecular underpinnings of muscular dystrophy.
Run03	Lethality	epi-1	gene	Mutations in the epi-1 gene were isolated in a screen devised to isolate mutants defective in gonad conversion from mesenchyme to epithelium. The mutations cause a distinct phenotype in C. elegans including lethality and defects in gonad morphogenesis.
Run04	Defective gonadal morphogenesis	epi-1	gene	Mutations in the epi-1 gene were identified in a screen designed to isolate mutants defective in gonad conversion from mesenchyme to epithelium in C. elegans, leading to defects in uterine precursor positioning, closure of the spermathecal lumen, and spreading of ovarian sheath cells over germ cells.
Run05	Lethality	epi-1	gene	Mutations in the epi-1 gene were isolated in a screen devised to isolate mutants defective in gonad conversion from mesenchyme to epithelium. The female somatic gonad of C. elegans is a cylindrical myoepithelium that surrounds the germ cells and sustains their maturation (Buechner et al. 1999; Hirsh et al. 1976; Kimble and Hirsh 1979). Like epidermis pharynx and intestine the gonad will epithelialize during its morphogenesis. However unlike other tissues in which the cell polarization occurs during gastrulation, the gonad polarizes late in larval development and is larger. As a result its morphogenesis is more easily observed. Mutants were isolated at the L3 and L4 stage in which the uterine precursors failed to exclude germ cells from the center of the gonad (the uterus), spermathecae failed to form a closed lumen, or the ovarian sheath cells failed to spread over the adjacent germ cells. One of the genes identified in this screen was designated epi-1 (epithelialization).
Run06	Lethality	epi-1	gene	Mutations in the epi-1 gene were isolated in a screen devised to isolate mutants defective in gonad conversion from mesenchyme to epithelium.

However, unlike other tissues in which the cell polarization occurs during gastrulation, the gonad polarizes late in larval development and is larger.

Mutants were isolated at the L3 and L4 stage in which the uterine precursors failed to exclude germ cells from the center of the gonad (the uterus), spermathecae failed to form a closed lumen or the ovarian sheath cells failed to spread over the adjacent germ cells.
Run07	abnormal cell-cell adhesions	laminin α subunit	gene	Mutations within each laminin α subunit gene cause abnormal cell-cell adhesions at regions associated with the localization of the subunit. Some cells fail to make the proper connections to adjacent tissues while other cells inappropriately adhere to and invade neighboring tissues. Affected cells may fail to properly differentiate or migrate suggesting widespread disruption of inductive interactions between adjacent tissues. Using electron microscopy we observe missing or abnormal extracellular matrix mispositioned adhesion complexes and disoriented cytoskeletal elements. For example, we observe on the surface of body wall muscle cells laminin organizes into a polygonal array and in mutants muscle cells may fail to properly adhere to the overlying epidermis. Muscle adhesion complexes and myofibrillar components are improperly positioned and in the epidermis the cytoskeleton is defective adjacent to where the muscle cells attach. Taken together our results are consistent with the idea that laminin plays a crucial role in organizing a supramolecular architecture comprising extracellular matrix receptors, and cytoskeletal components and that this architecture is important for regulating adhesion and signals between adjacent tissues.
Run08	Lethality	epi-1	gene	Mutations in the epi-1 gene were isolated in a screen devised to isolate mutants defective in gonad conversion from mesenchyme to epithelium, leading to lethal phenotypes. Mutants isolated include uterine precursors failing to exclude germ cells, spermathecae failing to form a closed lumen, and ovarian sheath cells failing to spread over adjacent germ cells.
Run09	Epithelialization defects	epi-1	gene	Mutations in the epi-1 gene were isolated in a screen devised to isolate mutants defective in gonad conversion from mesenchyme to epithelium. The female somatic gonad of C. elegans is a cylindrical myoepithelium that surrounds the germ cells and sustains their maturation. Like epidermis, pharynx, and intestine, the gonad will epithelialize during its morphogenesis. However, unlike other tissues in which the cell polarization occurs during gastrulation, the gonad polarizes late in larval development and is larger. As a result, its morphogenesis is more easily observed. Mutants were isolated at the L3 and L4 stage in which the uterine precursors failed to exclude germ cells from the center of the gonad (the uterus), spermathecae failed to form a closed lumen, or the ovarian sheath cells failed to spread over the adjacent germ cells.
Run10	muscular dystrophies	epi-1	gene	Mutations in laminin α2 are found in some congenital muscular dystrophies. In C. elegans, mutations in the epi-1 gene, which encodes a laminin α subunit, show disrupted basement membranes in body wall muscles, failed adherence to epidermis, and improperly oriented myofilaments, modeling aspects of congenital muscular dystrophies.
